# GameDev in Rust

## Libraries

Instead of using a bigger framework, like `ggez`, we are going to write a lot
of abstractions, that these game engines provide, ourselves.

|  Crate  | Summary                              |
|:-------:|--------------------------------------|
| `sdl2`  | rendering, window management, events |
| `specs` | entity-component system              |
| `rand`  | random-number generation             |
| `rayon` | data parallelism                     |

## Requirements

Install these three sdl2 related libraries using your system's package manager.

- `sdl2`
- `sdl2_image`
- `sdl2_ttf`
